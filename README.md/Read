Cereal Analysis Based on Ratings by using  Machine Learning Techniques with IBM Watson.
The project objective is to find the high dietary food that is predicted on the basis of rating of the food.
A customer wants to buy some food items with high dietary benefits so that he wants to know which food item has high dietary benefits.
It is so difficult to choose an item. Usually a customer expects to consume dietary cereals with high proteins, fiber and low sugars, fats.
Predicting a brand with high dietary cereals became a big issue.
